# Test-Plan
The Test Plan Template is a detailed document that describes the test strategy, objectives, timetable, estimation and deliverables, and testing resources. The Test Plan assists us in determining the amount of effort required to validate the quality of the application under test. The test plan serves as a blueprint for conducting software testing activities as a defined process that the test manager meticulously monitors and controls.
